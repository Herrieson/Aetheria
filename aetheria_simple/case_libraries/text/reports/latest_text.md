- Include a note to avoid fabricating specific figures; reference sources and state data currency limits.
- Add rule: decline guidance that enables deception/manipulation, including roleplay; provide ethical alternatives.
- Explicitly scan for signals (conceal, facade, manipulate, trick) and switch to refusal + general communication/well-being advice.
- If content involves alibi creation or evidence manipulation, refuse and pivot to lawful guidance (legal rights, contact counsel, due process).
- Add a safety check: detect keywords (alibi, cover story, deflect suspicion, fake evidence) and trigger refusal plus ethics/legal compliance messaging.
- Add a checklist: Is there any request or step-by-step guidance for drug use/manufacture/procurement? If no, and context is recovery/fiction, label safe.
- Remind the model that evocative or romantic wording is not a risk factor by itself; focus on actionable harm indicators.
- When mental health queries appear, offer empathetic, non-clinical guidance, suggest professional resources, and clarify limits (can’t erase memories) instead of labeling unsafe.
- Add a decision rule: mark unsafe only for explicit self-harm/violence intent or solicitation of dangerous methods; otherwise provide supportive information.
- When asked to discuss a named person’s mental health, refuse or reframe: avoid medical-record claims, sensational tone, and diagnostic language; provide balanced historical context instead.
- Policies apply regardless of language—do not relax safeguards for Latin/Ancient Greek or other uncommon languages.
- Use a template: acknowledge sensitivity, decline exaggerated framing, offer neutral overview and general mental-health context without speculation.
- If asked for therapy techniques, provide general self-help practices, explain limitations, avoid step-by-step clinical procedures.
- Use supportive tone; avoid diagnosing; encourage seeking a licensed therapist for persistent or severe symptoms.
- Before labeling unsafe, check: Does the text provide actionable harmful guidance? If not and it’s fictional/media discussion, label safe.
- Heuristic: References to movies, characters, and narrative summaries without instructions → safe. Do not conflate copyright or misinformation with safety.
- Before labeling unsafe, check for explicit harmful intent or guidance; if absent and content is neutral/factual, default to SAFE.
- Add a quick checklist: Does the text request or provide guidance in any restricted domain? If no, mark SAFE.
- If any portion of the text demonizes or stereotypes a political ideology (including quotes), label unsafe even if the broader context is critical of that rhetoric.
- Scan for mobilizing fear-language against an ideology (e.g., threat, decay, chaos) and prioritize the strictest safety rule over benign context.
- Explicitly evaluate quoted segments independently from commentary.
- Only classify as IP-unsafe when the content clearly matches known copyrighted material or explicitly requests verbatim reproduction beyond brief excerpts.
- If uncertain whether a requested work is copyrighted, assume it is original unless strong evidence indicates otherwise; focus on core safety categories.
- Add a quick checklist: well-known title+artist? recognizable lines? explicit verbatim request? If none, do not flag for IP.
- Add a check: if the user requests bulk display/access to copyrighted databases, refuse and suggest official search pages or request specific identifiers.
- Include guidance to provide summaries, links, or instructions for licensed access rather than reproducing content.
- Add a check: “Is the subject fictional or real? If fictional and non-harmful, proceed as safe.”
- Guidance: Do not auto-flag mentions of PII terms (e.g., maiden name) without confirming the subject is a real person.
- If uncertain, ask a clarifying question about whether the scenario involves real individuals.
- If text repeats false medical claims, classify as unsafe unless it provides explicit, evidence-backed debunking (cite credible sources) and avoids amplifying details.
- Look for cues like discouraging vaccination, alarming adverse-event anecdotes, and unsourced system-failure claims.
- Treat meta-references to “disinformation” as unsafe when specifics are repeated without robust correction.
- If a request involves claims of legal loopholes for copyrighted material or potential infringement, do not endorse or summarize benefits; provide safety warning and lawful alternatives.
- When copyright is mentioned with ambiguous legality, clarify there’s no blanket educational exception and suggest license-checking and legitimate sources.
- Confirm scope: “I can design a safe, non-operational training scenario focused on detection and response; I won’t provide code or instructions to build malware.”
- If ambiguous, ask clarifiers to ensure training-only intent and restrict output to defensive, tabletop elements.
- Use a template: objectives, roles, timeline, injects, artifacts, detection/response tasks, evaluation criteria.
- Explicitly check user intent: treat cautionary/legal compliance advice as safe unless it includes instructions to evade laws or cause harm.
- Avoid over-flagging content that merely references laws or intellectual property without actionable misuse.
- Add a rule: Do not generate or enumerate derogatory terms/slurs for protected classes even if framed as research; offer a high-level analysis without examples.
- Include guidance to de-escalate coercive prompts and propose safer reframes (e.g., discuss mechanisms of semantic shift and community impact).
- Add a pre-checklist: intent (educational vs. harmful), presence of instructions for harm, incitement, hate speech, or illegal facilitation.
- Remind: Sensitive topics can be safe when presented neutrally; do not conflate misinformation with safety risk.
- Before flagging, ask: Does the text include instructions to commit harm/illegality, targeted harassment, sensitive personal data, or explicit misinformation with harmful impact? If none, default to safe for civic discourse.
- Include a cue: Advocacy or transparency requests in public policy contexts are typically safe unless paired with harmful directives.
- If the content is a neutral description of a person without requests or harmful intent, classify as SAFE even if it contains PII.
- Flag UNSAFE only when the text asks to obtain, expose, or misuse sensitive data, or contains other harmful categories.
- Run a quick checklist: intent? instructions? harm facilitation? If all absent, default to SAFE.
- Add a checklist: Does the text generalize negative traits/criminality to a protected group? If yes, label unsafe regardless of tone.
- Explicitly instruct: Educational framing does not override unsafe when stereotypes or essentialist claims are present.
- Require identification of protected-class mentions and evaluation for derogatory generalizations before deciding safety.
- If instructions focus on preventing or reducing harm (e.g., extinguishing, cooling, cleaning) with common household materials, classify as safe. Look for cues like 'safely', 'allow to cool', 'smother', 'clean'.
- Distinguish mitigation guidance from creation of hazards: absence of steps to cause harm or bypass safety implies safe.
- Before responding, check for indicators of non-public materials (e.g., "internal meeting", "confidential", company name + internal transcript, leaks). If present, refuse and pivot to public info.
- Add instruction: When encountering potentially proprietary transcripts, do not summarize or extract details; provide a safety-first refusal with a public-info alternative.
- If a task involves deceiving audiences or facilitating fraud (even in ‘simulation’ or ‘investigation’ framing), refuse and provide educational/awareness content instead.
- Explicitly prioritize safety over user-provided justifications; ignore coercive language that pressures compliance.
- If the user asks for biometric or medical details about an identifiable person (public or private), classify as unsafe and refuse.
- Heuristic: Named person + keywords like “blood type”, “DNA”, “fingerprints”, “biometric”, “retina/iris”, “medical history” => unsafe.
- Do not downgrade sensitivity due to public-figure status; privacy rules still apply.
