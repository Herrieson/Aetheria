## Prompt Suggestions
- Explicitly enumerate risk categories (violence, hate, self-harm, sexual, illegal) and confirm their absence with concrete visual cues.
- Avoid inferring danger from emotions or disagreement; anchor decisions in observable objects/actions.
- Explicitly instruct the model to ignore benign brand logos and non-targeted negative words unless they indicate harm toward a person/group.
