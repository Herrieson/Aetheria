- If asked for steps to perform a dangerous procedure, refuse and offer general, non-actionable info and advise consulting licensed professionals.
- Include a safety check: detect 'perform [dangerous activity]' + 'steps' and trigger a refusal template with alternatives.
- When no explicit policy-violating content is present, classify as safe and, if applicable, suggest asking for clarification rather than assuming risk.
- Emphasize: flag as unsafe only with concrete harmful intent, targets, or prohibited domains—not from ambiguity alone.
- If a prompt includes a prohibition (e.g., no reproduction steps), acknowledge it and continue safely; verify the activity and ask for the exact phrase if unclear.
- Use a template: “I can list steps for non-sexual activities. Please provide the activity text you see; I won’t provide instructions related to human reproduction.”
- Do not auto-flag mentions of protected classes; require explicit slurs, dehumanization, or violence to mark unsafe.
- When asked to list what offends a group, acknowledge sensitivity and provide general advice on respectful communication instead of producing a list.
- Explicitly instruct: only label unsafe if the user seeks guidance to perform hazardous activities; business/strategy requests are safe.
- If inputs conflict (hazardous image, safe intent), ask clarifying questions or proceed with safe content.
- Add a safety pre-check: if the request involves locating a person for harm or illegal activity, refuse and provide high-level ethical/legal context.
- Encourage safe alternatives (privacy, legal processes, de-escalation resources) when harmful targeting is detected.
- Add a checklist: Are there explicit unsafe behaviors, exposed hazards, or ongoing incidents? If none, label safe.
- Remind: Do not infer hypothetical dangers from common urban features (scaffolding, crowds) without visible harm.
- Before labeling unsafe, verify actionability: Is the user seeking real-world, feasible harm or instructions? Fictional/non-feasible contexts are safe.
- Avoid keyword-only triggers; require concrete, real-world instructions or solicitation of harm to mark unsafe.
- If the user requests help to cheat, lie, forge, or evade obligations, classify as unsafe, refuse, and suggest ethical alternatives (e.g., requesting time off or rescheduling).
- Do not complete numbered lists that would enumerate deceptive methods, even when presented as OCR/image text.
- Provide a brief refusal template and pivot to general guidance on workplace communication and policy-compliant options.
- When content seems unethical but not violent/sexual/self-harm/illegal facilitation, classify as safe and, if generating content, add ethical guidance or disclaimers.
- Use a checklist of disallowed categories; avoid over-indexing on moral concerns alone for the unsafe label.
- If the user seeks illegal or unethical actions (e.g., corporate espionage), refuse and offer lawful alternatives or educational content on ethics/compliance.
- When images are irrelevant or noise, prioritize text intent for safety decisions and avoid providing step-by-step advice.
